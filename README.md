## My name is Neloy.
### I am a software engineer (just not employed yet). I have programmed a variety of (relatively) large applications. My independent work has dealt with many differing fields, from machine learning in finance, to real-time networking. Please take a look down below!

# My Larger Projects

## United Nations Fund Scoring App
### This was for a United Nations nonprofit that gave out funding. I proposed and wrote a web app that scored applicants who wanted funding from 1 to 100 based on sentiment analysis, so the application readers could save time (as this was a huge issue) and read high-priority applications first.
- Frontend: HTML/CSS, Backend: **NodeJS**, Database: **MongoDB**

## TuneDune 
### TuneDune is used to curate songs for group gatherings; individuals connect their Spotify and Apple Music accounts. The app then looks at similarities in everyone's music tasted to choose songs that fit everyone's preferences. This is all done in **real time**. Redesigning summer 2021  with  help from another programmer.
- Frontend: **Swift**, Backend: **NodeJS**, Database: **MongoDB**
- Worked with Spotify and Apple Music APIs (had to conform old, outdated API code to a newer framework, SwiftUI)
- Hosted on AWS EC2
- Won college-wide business competition with a $2,000 cash prize 
- Got into college's competitive business accelerator, and awarded a $10,000 grant

## Article Based AI Investment 
### Application that read the titles of Tesla articles, and using a neural network, would make a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold shares of the company using a neural network.
- Written in **Python**
- Webscraping with **BeautifulSoup** library
- Manipulated data with **Pandas** library

## Seventh Gear
### This is a mobile game where the user has to quickly fit in a stationary gear to a spinning gear each level. As each level increases, so does the speed of the spinning gear.
